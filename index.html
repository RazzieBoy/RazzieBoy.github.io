                        I am from a small town in the southern part of Sweden. From a young age I was fascinated by computers and video games. 
                        This fascination led to me studying video game development in high school at LBS Halmstad, 
                        directly after I graduated high school I packed my bags and went to further my knowledge and education in Software Engineering at Yoobee Colleges in New Zealand.
